## Mission Statement:

Welcome to WSSD Parents for Balanced Tech Use! Our mission is to create a supportive and non-judgmental community for parents within the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District to foster open conversations and shared learning about the impact of smartphones and social media on our children.

We acknowledge that every family parents differently, but we all share the goal of making informed and intentional choices regarding our children's tech use.

Our objectives are:

  * Community Learning
  * Fostering Communication
  * Empowering Families
  
We are exploring a parent pact based on the book [The Anxious Generation](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/book) by [Jonathan Haidt](https://jonathanhaidt.com/anxious-generation/) and his 4 new norms:

1) No smartphones before high school
2) No social media before age 16
3) Phone-free schools
4) More independence, free play, and responsibility in the real world.

If you aren't sure or your kids already have a smartphone, please join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/915060343634375) anyway ðŸ™‚
