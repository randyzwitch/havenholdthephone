Haven Hold The Phone is a supportive and inclusive community within the [Wallingford-Swarthmore School District](https://wssd.org/) where families can access reliable information and engage in open discussions about the impact of smartphones and social media on children. 

Families have the option to join neighbors in a pledge to delay providing a smartphone to their children until high school and social media use until they turn 16.
